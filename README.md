The use of acquisitions to redirect and reshape corporate strategy has never been bigger. Companies today regard buying another company to access various resources less risky and speedier than gaining these resources internally. 
While some acquisitions become the talk of the town, there are several acquisitions which although important are not immensely highlighted because of factors such as the deal size, the company’s brand value in the market or the companies not announcing certain acquisitions. Everyone knows Facebook’s acquisition of Whatsapp and Instagram but how many know that Facebook also acquired UK-based Atlas ML. Moreover, everybody knows where Whatsapp and Instagram are in the market either through news or articles but do we really get to know what happens to companies like Atlas ML post acquisition. 
This created curiosity and motivated us to study further on how these less known acquisitions align with the company’s strategies and how the acquired companies are managed post-acquisition.
